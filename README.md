# Crime, Poverty and Median Home Values
Our hypothesis is the following. We hypothesize that a decrease in the violent crime rate results in reductions in the poverty rate and a simultaneous increase in median income and median home prices. Our confidence level is 95% or a p-value of 0.05. We hypothesize that the p-value of these statistics in Oak Park, zip codes 95817 and 95820, is statistically different from Sacramento County. Our observed variables are the crime rate, poverty rate, income rate, and median home prices of Oak Park and Sacramento County. Our expected values are the crime rate, poverty rate, income rate, and median home prices for all of Sacramento County. Based on the observed versus the typical values, we can calculate the p-value. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we will accept the hypothesis. This analysis matters as police forces could use it to understand better where to assign resources.
## Questions
1.	What are the total crime trends in Sacramento County and Oak Park in particular?
2.	What are the Oak Park crimes and personal crimes for 2014-2018?
3.	How would a heat map of the crime for each zip code in Sacramento county look appear?
4.	How would a heat map of the poverty rate for each zip code in Sacramento count appear?
5.	What are the overall personal crimes versus poverty for Sacramento county for 2014-2018?
6.	Is there a correlation between the poverty rate and the crime rate
7.	Is there a correlation between home prices and the crime rate?

## Overall Analysis
We had a couple of hypotheses:    
•	Rising Median Home Prices leads to Lower Crime Rates  
•	Rising Poverty Rates leads to Higher Crime Rates  
The data for Sacramento County overall met these expectations. When we looked explicitly at Oak Park, results from the data were mixed. Oak Park had a lowering Crime Rate as Median House Price went up, as expected. Oak Park also had a lowering Crime Rate as the Poverty Rate went up. More research into Oak Park is needed to understand the discrepancy better
