# Crime_and_Poverty
Our hypothesis is the following. We hypothesize that a decrease in the violent crime rate results in decreases in the poverty rate and an simultaneous increase in median income and median home prices. Our confidence level is 95% or a p-value of 0.05. We hypothesize that the p-value of these statistics in Oak Park, zip codes 95817 and 95820, is statistically different from the rest of the population, which consists of the rest of Sacramento County. Our observed variables are the crime rate, poverty rate, income rate, and median home prices of Oak Park. Our expected values are the crime rate, poverty rate, income rate, and median home prices for all of Sacramento County. Based upon the observed versus the expected values we can calculate the p-value. If the p-value is greater than 0.95 we will accept the hypothesis and test it out by applying it to the rest of Sacramento County.
